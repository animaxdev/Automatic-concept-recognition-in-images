# Automatic concept recognition in images

This project aims to implement a strong C++ algorithm for concept recognition in images based on Neural Networks. Moreover, it implements a friendly user interface for testing using Qt library. We also use the well-known OpenCv library for images processing and classification. Our method is a two phases approach. First, we detect and localize a concept (shape) in an image. Then, we recognize and classify the concept with our Neral Networks. However, before starting detection and classification, we need to :

- choose a specific dataset
- 
to use our Neral Networks, we need to train it with a specific dataset.
